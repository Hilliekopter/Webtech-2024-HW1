                        Harry is the main character, he is so big and cool 
                        and really smart also. His parents are dead, but 
                        he wont let that stop him!

                        Ron is the funny second guy, he is funny and charismatic, 
                        and funny too! Sadly, he dies at the end of the book. I was
                        very sad when this happened, but sometimes that is life.
