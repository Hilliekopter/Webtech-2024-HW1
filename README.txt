  The DOM manipulation menus can be found in the footer of each page. These menus can
be used to change the font, the font size, the text color and the background color. The
user can press ENTER on the value input bar to apply the change. This code is found in
the Scripts/editor.js file.
  Event propagation can be found in the form of the table on the characters.html page,
the different rows and cells can be highlighted by clicking on them, the code is found
in Scripts/table.js.
  Dynamically generated tooltips generated from info can be found on the info.html page. 
All content on this page is generated on the fly using the ES6 classes. This code is found 
in Scripts/info.js.

  Aside from the main requirements, we also applied the feedback from assignment 1. For 
accessibility, we changed the <h2> in the header to a <span>, and added <thead> and <tbody>
elements to the table on the characters.html page.
  Also, in the first assignment, the feedback was we didnt use the "design for mobile 
first" principle, as the nav bar was not formatted properly on mobile. This should be fixed 
now.
