        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Ten-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan who lives in the
            fictional London suburb of Little Whinging, Surrey, with
            the Dursleys: his uncaring Aunt Petunia, loathsome Uncle
            Vernon, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys barely
            tolerate Harry, and Dudley bullies him. One day Harry is
            astonished to receive a letter addressed to him in the
            cupboard under the stairs (where he sleeps). Before he
            can open the letter, however, Uncle Vernon takes it.
            Letters for Harry subsequently arrive each day, in
            increasing numbers, but Uncle Vernon tears them all up,
            and finally, in an attempt to escape the missives, the
            Dursleys go to a miserable shack on a small island. On
            Harry’s 11th birthday, a giant named Hagrid arrives and
            reveals that Harry is a wizard and that he has been
            accepted at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
            Wizardry. He also sheds light on Harry’s past, informing
            the boy that his parents, a wizard and a witch, were
            killed by the evil wizard Voldemort and that Harry
            acquired the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead during
            the fatal confrontation.</p>

        <p>Upon arrival at the school, the students are sorted into
            one of four houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or
            Slytherin. Harry ends up in Gryffindor, and during his
            eventful first year at Hogwarts he becomes close friends
            with two other members of the house, Ron Weasley, who
            comes from an old wizarding family, and Hermione Granger,
            whose parents are Muggles (those who are not magical).
            Harry also finds that he has an enemy in Draco Malfoy
            (Slytherin). In addition, Harry’s prowess in flying on a
            broomstick makes him a star of Gryffindor’s Quidditch
            team. Hoping to get Harry and his friends into trouble,
            Draco tricks them into leaving their rooms one night, a
            violation of school rules. While trying to avoid being
            caught, they discover a three-headed dog guarding a
            trapdoor. Harry gradually comes to the conclusion that
            Professor Snape, who teaches Potions, dislikes him
            intensely and is trying to get hold of whatever is
            behind the trapdoor. Harry receives his father’s cloak
            of invisibility as a Christmas gift, and, while
            exploring under the cloak’s cover, he finds the Mirror
            of Erised, in which he can see his parents. Later,
            headmaster Albus Dumbledore explains that the mirror
            shows the viewer’s deepest desire.</p>

        <p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione deduce that the treasure under
            the trapdoor is the Philosopher’s Stone, which can
            transform metal into gold and can also confer
            immortality. They later discover that Voldemort has been
            killing unicorns in the Forbidden Forest and drinking
            their blood, another way to achieve immortality. The
            trio comes to believe that Snape is in league with the
            evil wizard. After learning that Hagrid revealed the
            secret way to lull the three-headed dog to sleep to a
            suspicious stranger, whom they believe to be either
            Snape or Voldemort, they are certain that the
            Philosopher’s Stone is in danger. The three classmates
            use the cloak of invisibility on a secret mission to get
            the Stone themselves to keep it from Voldemort. After
            getting past the dog and defeating various protective
            spells, Harry reaches the room in which the Stone is
            hidden and is surprised to find the perpetually nervous
            Professor Quirrell there. Quirrell fails to figure out
            how to retrieve the Stone from the Mirror of Erised (the
            final protective measure) and forces Harry to try. When
            standing in front of the mirror, wishing only to protect
            the Stone and not use it for himself, Harry feels the
            Stone’s weight in his pocket but refuses to tell
            Quirrell that he has it. Quirrell unwraps his turban,
            revealing Voldemort’s face on the back of his head.
            Voldemort explains that he has been sharing Quirrell’s
            body until he can get to the Stone and become fully
            alive again, and Voldemort/Quirrell and Harry fight for
            possession of the Stone, until Harry blacks out. He
            awakens in the infirmary and learns that Dumbledore
            saved him, the Stone is to be destroyed, and Voldemort
            escaped.</p>
