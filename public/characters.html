                        The protagonist of the story, who is gradually
                        transformed from timid weakling to powerful hero
                        by the end. Marked on the forehead with a
                        lightning-shaped scar, Harry is marked also by
                        the confrontation between good and bad magic
                        that caused that scar: the standoff between the
                        evil Voldemort and his parents who died to save
                        their son. The story eventually becomes a tale
                        of Harry’s vengeance for their wrongful deaths.
                        As he matures, he shows himself to be caring and
                        shrewd, a loyal friend, and an excellent
                        Quidditch player.

                    <td>
                        Ron Weasley
                    </td>
                    <td>A shy, modest boy who comes from an impoverished
                        wizard family. Ron is Harry’s first friend at
                        Hogwarts, and they become close. He lacks
                        Harry’s gusto and charisma, but his loyalty and
                        help are useful to Harry throughout their
                        adventures. Ron’s mediocrity despite his wizard
                        background reminds us that success at Hogwarts
                        is based solely on talent and hard work, not on
                        family connections. Ron’s willingness to be
                        beaten up by the monstrous chess queen shows how
                        selfless and generous he is.

                    <td>Hermione Granger</td>
                    <td>Initially an annoying goody-two-shoes who studies
                        too much and obeys the school rules too
                        zealously. Hermione eventually becomes friendly
                        with Harry after she learns to value friendship
                        over perfectionism and obedience. She comes from
                        a purely Muggle family, and her character
                        illustrates the social-adjustment problems often
                        faced by new students at Hogwarts.</td>

                    <td>
                        Albus Dumbledore
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        The kind, wise head of Hogwarts. Though he is a
                        famous wizard, Dumbledore is as humble and
                        adorable as his name suggests. While other
                        school officials, such as Professor McGonagall,
                        are obsessed with the rules, Dumbledore respects
                        them (as his warnings against entering the
                        Forbidden Forest remind us) but does not
                        exaggerate their importance. He appears to have
                        an almost superhuman level of wisdom, knowledge,
                        and personal understanding, and it seems that he
                        may have set up the whole quest for the
                        Sorcerer’s Stone so that Harry could prove
                        himself.

                    <td>
                        Rubeus Hagrid
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        An oafish giant who works as a groundskeeper at
                        Hogwarts. Rubeus Hagrid is a well-meaning
                        creature with more kindness than brains. He cares
                        deeply for Harry, as evidenced by the tears he
                        sheds upon having to leave the infant Harry with
                        the Dursleys. His fondness for animals is
                        endearing, even if it gets him into trouble
                        (as when he tries raising a dragon at home).
                        Hagrid symbolizes the importance of generosity
                        and human warmth in a world menaced by conniving
                        villains.

                    <td>
                        Severus Snape
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        A professor of Potions at Hogwarts. Severus Snape
                        dislikes Harry and appears to be an evil man for
                        most of the story. His name associates him not
                        only with unfair snap judgments of others but also
                        with his violent intentions to snap the bones of
                        his enemies. Snape’s grudge against Harry, which
                        is nevertheless far from a murderous ill will,
                        helps us remember the difference between
                        forgivable vices and unforgivable evil intentions.
